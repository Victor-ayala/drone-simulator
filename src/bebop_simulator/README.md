# bebop_simulator
A ROS package that simulates the Parrot Bebop. It also contains an implementation that simulates landing platforms that move with constant speed.

It is part of a ROS eco-system of packages that allow an autonomous UAV to land on a moving platform, using only a front-facing camera.
